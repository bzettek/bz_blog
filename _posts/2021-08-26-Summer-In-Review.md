I have just settled back into Bloomington and am getting ready for a challenging semester of
junior year coursework.
This summer I made some amazing progress on my journey to becoming an engineer. I had a great
internship experience and learned quite a bit about web development.

Here are the main technologies I used over the summer:
* JavaScript
* React.js
* Node.js
* HTML5
* CSS
* Visual Studio Code
<p> </p>
This internship pushed me to become a better engineer in many ways. In this blog post, I am using things I learned during it!
The most important lesson I learned when it comes to solving problems is to break it down into small bite sized pieces. Anytime I try to take the whole thing on at once my mind becomes boggled and I struggle. Also, communication is integral to success
when it comes to any sort of technical role. I didn't realize how important this was until I started facing hardships.
I'm grateful to have had such a good opportunity early in my career and can't wait to continue progressing.
