This upcoming semester is shaping up to be the best yet. Being back in person is great, and my classes are all
interesting.

This semester I am taking courses in the following areas:
 * High Performance Computing(HPC)
 * Cyber-Physical Systems(Self-Driving Robot)
 * Engineering Mathematics(Linear Algebra)
 * Circuits and Digital Design
 * Accounting

Technologies I'm using in these classes:
* Python
* C
* Linux
* Virtual Machines
* Super Computers(Big Red II)
* Raspberry Pi

The last bullet point has me excited. The course I am taking in High Performance Computing is
being taught by a very well know figure in Super Computing. [Thomas Sterling.](https://luddy.indiana.edu/contact/profile/?profile_id=303)
From the two lectures I've watched, IU's supercomputer Big Red II is in the middle of the pact when it comes to how fast it is
compared to other supercomputers. We are going to be able to actually run some programs on it too!

Another class worth highlighting is my Cyber-Physical Systems class. The gist of this class is that it is very project based.
I learn the most by doing, so I can't wait to dig in. We are assembling a robot with a Raspberry Pi embedded in the middle. This allows for us to do all sorts of fun stuff. For example, we are going to mount a camera module and make it so that it can detect obstacles via the camera.
