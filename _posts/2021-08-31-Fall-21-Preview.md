This upcoming semester is shaping up to be the best yet. Being back in person is great, and my classes are all
interesting.

This semester I am taking courses in the following areas:
 * Cyber-Physical Systems(Self-Driving Robot)
 * Engineering Mathematics(Linear Algebra)
 * Circuits and Digital Design
 * Accounting

Technologies I'm using in these classes:
* Python
* C
* Linux
* Virtual Machines
* Raspberry Pi

Another class worth highlighting is my Cyber-Physical Systems class. The gist of this class is that it is very project based.
I learn the most by doing, so I can't wait to dig in. We are assembling a robot with a Raspberry Pi embedded in the middle. This allows for us to do all sorts of fun stuff. For example, we are going to mount a camera module and make it so that it can detect obstacles via the camera.

    Note: I am a student and am still learning. I try my best to only provide 100% accurate information. If you notice something that doesn't sound quite right. Please contact me!
