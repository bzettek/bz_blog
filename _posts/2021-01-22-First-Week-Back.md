The first week back at school went pretty well. I got a feeling after this semester. I'll be able to start creating some pretty cool stuff. The courses I am taking are Physics 2, Cyber-Physical Systems, Intelligent Systems 2, and Systems and signals.

I will list the technologies I'm using in these classes below.

On top of classes, I am working on participating in some pretty exciting research with a professor. It is cybersecurity based and backed by the NSA. The research will be primarily on the Linux Pseudorandom number generator and entropy in cryptographic keys. The main goal is to perform an entropy analysis that will allow us to create a detailed report. I'll post updates as work progresses.
