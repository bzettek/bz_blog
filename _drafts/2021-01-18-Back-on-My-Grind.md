So, here I am again back at school. I can't say I prepared too much for this semester prior, which I always say I'm going to do. I'm okay with this because everything seems to be lining up.

I think I've finally found my groove. I've spent a lot of time thinking about where I am in my life and what I want. I figured out the whole time I was contributing to how I felt. I was thinking way too much and in my head. I'm pretty sure this is why I'm always in a better mood at school. I have less time to slow myself down because I'm engaged in my studies.

A big reason for my change in attitude is this audiobook I've been listening to on my runs. It's called *Can't Hurt Me* by David Goggins. I'm only two chapters in, but I can already tell this book is a game-changer. It's about a guy who has probably the worst childhood I've heard of and eventually turns his life around. He does this by blocking his mind out and just getting it done. My favorite part about it is he doesn't want people to be motivated by his story. At first, this may seem backward, but motivation comes and goes. Self-discipline is continuous. I'm excited to continue to listen and apply parts to my life.

They say basketball is a game of runs. Meaning you're either up big or down big. This probably the best comparison I can think of for life. Momentum builds one way or another, and man can it be hard to break it. The past few weeks, I went down 20 in the 1st quarter.  It was terrible, but I can't wait for the future. I'm going to be up going into halftime.
