My name is Brandon Zettek. I am currently studying Computer Engineering at Indiana University. I am exploring many routes in computing to see what I want to do in my life. All I know for sure is I want to better peopleâ€™s lives through technology.

On this website, you can find posts and projects that I think are important to who I am. I plan to post things I believe to be vital to my success in my field.
